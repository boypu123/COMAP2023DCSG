            <h2> What is HiMCM/MidMCM?</h2>
            <p>
                COMAP'S High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM) 
                and Middle Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MidMCM) 
                are international contests designed to provide high school and 
                middle school/level students with the opportunity to work as team members 
                to engage and improve their modeling, problem solving, and writing skills. 
                Contest problems are accessible using the mathematics taught at the 
                respective levels of the contests. <br>
                In this competition, you are required to complete an <b>essay</b> during the 14 days window. 
                The essay needs to be on a question selected on the first day of the contest. 
                The contest period is November 1st to November 14th. 
                <br>
                <b>HiMCM</b>: There are two questions to be choose from, Question A and Question B. <br>
                For <b>Y11, Y12, Y13 students. </b>
                <br>
                <b>MidMCM</b>: There is only one question. Question C. <br>
                For students below <b>14.5 years old</b> at the start of the contest.
            </p>

            <h2>What is mathematical modelling?</h2>
            <p>
                Mathematical modelling is a skill that applies mathematical knowledge into real world context. 
                In mathematical modelling, you are required to use relevant mathematical knowledge, as well as some extra knowledge in the related 
                fields, to build a mathematical equation. You may be asked to predict what is going to happen next, or the trend of what has been happening.

            <h2>What are the prerequisites?</h2>
            <p>

                There are no specific prerequisites, but you are expected to know some content in IGCSE extended/additional mathematics and in IB AA maths as well.<br>
                Some possible prerequisites are:<br>

                Basic Python Programming Skills:<br>
                -	Including but not limited to data types, control statements, functions (All the syllabus req. in IGCSE Computer Science 0478)<br>
                -	NumPy<br>
                -	Pandas<br>
                -	Visualisation<br>
                -	Flowcharts<br>
                -	Diagrams<br>
                -	Data Diagrams<br>

                Evaluating Models:<br>
                -	Entropy Weight Method<br>
                -	Analytic Hierarchy Process<br>
                -	TOPSIS<br>

                Models:<br>
                -	Linear Programming<br>

                Prediction Models:<br>
                -	Linear Regression Model<br>
                -	Data Fitting<br>
                -	Machine Learning (Basic, using scikit-learn)<br>
                -	Grey Prediction Model (GM (1,1) is preferred)<br>

                Linear Algebra<br>
                -	Matrix Addition<br>
                -	Matrix Multiplication<br>

                Basic Computational Thinking Skills + Algorithm:<br>
                -	Decomposition of Problems<br>
                -	Greedy Algorithm<br>

                Writing Mathematical Essay:<br>
                -	Section Organisation<br>
                -	Writing an Abstract<br>
                -	Experiences<br>

                Again, this only provides an overview and is not necessarily the case depending on the questions. Anyway, these are very easy things to learn as well. You can probably learn it within 3 days if you take 2 hours per day.
